**Deriving emotional feeling invoked by a piece of text. It involves extracting meaning from natural language and assigning it a numerical score depicting the range of positive or negative sentiment conveyed by the text**<br>

**for ex. - "Apple share price dropped by 30% due to Covid19 lockdown" conveys a very negative sentiment. However - "I bought a new house" conveys a positive sentiment**<br>
**"A bus is moving on the road" - conveys a neutral sentiment**
